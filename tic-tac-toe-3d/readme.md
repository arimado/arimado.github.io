#TIC-TAC-TOE 3D

My first Three.js game!

Design inspired by: [Karim Maaloul's 'Aviator' Animation](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/)

To Do:

- Add 'draw' condition
- Add 'end' condition animation
- Get winning objects
    - Push winning objects down in to the water


---

Tips:

- Instead of "changes happen anywhere at anytime" You can then say "all requested changes pass into and are verified and executed through this one workflow function"
- So now a humble "click" doesn't change anything. It just tells update what it wants to change and update thinks about it and takes it from there.
